            <h2>Why you should try Italian pine nut cookies</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for sweet, nutty, rich cookies, you’ll appreciate pine nut cookies. This gourmet delicacy, known as <i>pignoli</i> or <i>pignolate</i> in the Italian tradition, is well worth exploring. If you’ve ever craved a treat that feels both luxurious and homey, pine nut cookies are definitely worth trying. </p>

            <h2>Taste disturbance warning!!</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>It’s a bitter truth that pine nuts can cause some people to experience a metallic or bitter taste, a condition known as <i>pine mouth syndrome</i>. This aftertaste, although rare, may begin 12 hours after consuming pine nuts and can last from a few days up to several weeks. Thousands of cases have been reported in which people describe their sense of taste as distorted, diminished, or even temporarily lost. In some cases, this has resulted in a reduced appetite and a period of full-on “nuttiness.”

            <h2>Gluten free and vegan considerations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gluten-free:</strong> 
                    Pine nut cookies don’t actually require wheat flour. Classic <i>pignoli</i> recipes often omit flour altogether, relying instead on almond paste and egg whites as binders. This means the pine nut cookies can naturally be prepared gluten-free. </li>
                <li><strong>Vegan:</strong>
                    To make vegan pine nut cookies, some adjustments are needed. Egg whites can be omitted, and regular butter can be substituted with vegan butter alternatives.
                     </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>Store pine nut brittle in an airtight container at room 
                temperature. Use it as a snack, gift, or topping for desserts
                 like ice cream or yogurt.</p>

            <h2>Great deals</h2>
            <p>For an expensive nut like pine nuts, you can find that the 
                best deals are from buying from bulk.

            <h2>Nutritional benefits of pine nut cookies</h2>
            <p> Although there isn’t a single “healthiest nut,” pine nuts, like most nuts, are rich in healthy fats that support heart health, packed with antioxidants, and full of nutrients. Because pine nuts are calorically dense, moderation is key. Compared to more processed cookie options, however, pine nut cookies offer elevated nutritional value and a wholesome flavor from high-quality ingredients.

        <p>Hello! My name is Constance Maybalm. As a 
           pine nut enthusiast who loves sharing her
        passion with the world - from gifting treats to 
        my friends and family, and giving cooking and 
        baking classes in my community,
        to sharing my favourite recipes 
        online - I am always learning new things to share on my 
        special little corner of the internet. I hope you share 
        my interest in sprinkling pine nuts on everything you 
        enjoy, even if it's just the occasional treat!
