            <h2>Why you should try pine nut cookies!</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for a cookie that is nutty, sweet, 
                and rich, you'll appreciate the pine nut cookie. This
                gourmet delicacy well worth exploring is known as pignoli 
                or pignolate in the italian tradition. If you have ever craved
                a treat that is luxurious yet homey, this cookie might be worth
                trying. </p>

            <h2>Taste disturbance warning!!</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>It's a bitter truth that pine nuts can cause some people 
                    to experience a metallic or bitter taste, a disturbance known
                    as the 'pine mouth' syndrome. This bitter aftertaste, although
                    rare, may begin 12 hours after consuming pine nuts and last
                    from a few days up to several weeks. Thousands of cases have been
                    reported by people describing that their sense of taste has 
                    been distorted, diminished or even 
                    dissapeared for a long period of time (about several weeks),
                    resulting in a loss of apetite 
                    and the onset of full on nuttiness.

            <h2>Considerations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gluten-free:</strong> 
                    Pine nut cookies don't actually need 
                wheat flour as is the case for the classic pignoli recipes 
                which omit flour altogether. Since they rely on almond
                paste and egg whites as binders, these biscuits can naturally
                be prepared gluten-free. </li>
                <li><strong>Vegan:</strong> </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Store pine nut brittle in an airtight container at room 
                temperature. Use it as a snack, gift, or topping for desserts
                 like ice cream or yogurt.</p>

            <h2>Nutritional benefits</h2>
            <p> Although there isn't one healthiest nut to consume, 
                they are all rich in healthy fats that are good
                for the heart, loads of antioxidants, and full of 
                nutrients.
